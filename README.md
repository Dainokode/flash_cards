# Python Flash Cards

Python flash cards is a small application to learn French.  It shows a card with a French word then reveal the translation in English after three seconds.
If the user clicks on the ✔ button, the word will be removed from the list of words(csv), but if the user clicks on the 
❌ button, the word will be added to a new csv file "words-to-learn" that will be loaded next time the program is run.
